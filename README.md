# Overview
The movie app is a web application that allows users to check the latest movies based on categories. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse movies and filter them based on genre, release year, and other criteria. The app is built using Node.js and Express, and it utilizes a database to store movie data.
# Getting Started
To build and run the movie app on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js on your machine if it's not already installed.

2. Clone the movie app repository from GitHub to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the command line interface.

4. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.

5. Run npm start to start the server and launch the app on your local machine.
# Project Features

This project is a web application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in a SQL database. The application is built using Express and Node.js and utilizes a third-party API to fetch additional data.

## Building a Server

The backend of the application is built using Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. Express is used to handle HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware, and other common web application tasks.

## 3rd Party API

To fetch additional data, the application utilizes a third-party API. This API is accessed using HTTP requests and returns data in JSON format.

## Databases

The application uses a SQL database to store and retrieve data. Specifically, the application uses PostgreSQL as its database management system. Sequelize, a popular ORM for Node.js, is used to interact with the database.

## CRUD Backend

The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on data stored in the database. This means users can create new data, read existing data, update data, and delete data.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Railway, a cloud platform for running and scaling web applications. Railway provides a simple CLI for deploying and managing applications, and automatically handles many of the infrastructure-related tasks, such as provisioning servers and setting up load balancers.

The application is currently deployed and can be accessed at the following URL: [Link](https://movies-library-production-6ce9.up.railway.app/).
